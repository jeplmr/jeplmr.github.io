      "content_html": "<p>This might be a bit of a long post.</p>\n<p>I think I got my first &quot;look behind the curtain&quot; was with <i>Return to Castle Wolfenstein</i>. I remember when my brother bought the game at a local Walmart. I think it may have been a &quot;Game of the Year&quot; edition or something, because I vaguely remember the box came with a bunch of extras. Most notably, a developer highlight reel (After some quick Googling, I found the reel <a href=\"https://youtu.be/BC_KoTZbRQA\" target=\"blank\">here</a>). I guess that must have been around 2002. So. I was well under the &quot;M 17+&quot; age rating of the game.</p>\n<p>Fast forward a couple years, and a small indie game called <i>Half-Life 2</i> comes out in 2004. You've probably never heard of it. Anyway, my brother and I both were looking forward to this one as we were both fans of the first game.</p>\n",

Whoops! #MVP</p>\n<p>Anyway, please excuse the dust around here. I haven't stretched my web design skills in a hot minute.
