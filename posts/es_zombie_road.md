<p>This was one of my first Unity projects. I was getting a feel for how to build out more natural looking spaces inside the editor. The scene features lush foliage, natural sound effects, and rocky terrain. I'm a bit of a paranormal junkie, so the overall look and feel of this scene was inspired by a St. Louis urban legend, "zombie road".
