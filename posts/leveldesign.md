This might be a bit of a long post.

I think I got my first "look behind the curtain" was with <i>Return to Castle Wolfenstein</i>. I remember when my brother bought the game at a local Walmart. I think it may have been a "Game of the Year" edition or something, because I vaguely remember the box came with a bunch of extras. Most notably, a developer highlight reel (After some quick Googling, I found the reel <a href="https://youtu.be/BC_KoTZbRQA" target="blank">here</a>). I guess that must have been around 2002. So. I was well under the "M 17+" age rating of the game.

Fast forward a couple years, and a small indie game called <i>Half-Life 2</i> comes out in 2004. You've probably never heard of it. Anyway, my brother and I both were looking forward to this one as we were both fans of the first game.
