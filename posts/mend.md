<p>Mend is an asymmetric coop game where virtual reality and flatscreen gameplay coalesce. Two players must work together to solve puzzles and explore the world. I built the vertical slice of Mend for Oculus Launch Pad. The project even went on to win the <a href="https://www.oculus.com/blog/introducing-the-2019-oculus-launch-pad-scholarship-recipients-plus-2020-applications-now-open/" target="blank">2019 Launch Pad Scholarship</a>! Mend's vertical slice was a ton of fun to develop. I got to lead a team of artists, programmers, and a composer, and eventually pitch the game on-site at Oculus HQ!</p>
