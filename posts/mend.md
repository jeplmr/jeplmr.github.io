<p>Mend is an asymmetric co-op game where virtual reality and flatscreen gameplay coalesce. Two players must work together to solve puzzles and explore the world. The vertical slice of Mend was built for <a href="https://developer.oculus.com/launch-pad/" target="blank">Oculus Launch Pad</a>, an incubator program ran directly by Oculus. The project even went on to win the <a href="https://www.oculus.com/blog/introducing-the-2019-oculus-launch-pad-scholarship-recipients-plus-2020-applications-now-open/" target="blank">2019 Launch Pad Scholarship</a>! Mend's vertical slice was a ton of fun to develop. Not only did it help validate my own XR development skills to myself, but I also led a team of fantastic artists and programmers. I even got to pitch the game on-site at Oculus HQ in Menlo Park!</p>
