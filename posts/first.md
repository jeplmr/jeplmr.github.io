<p>I decided to rework my portfolio/blog from scratch. I was running static HTML/CSS on an Amazon S3 bucket, and finally decided it was high time to do things "the right way". This site utilizes 11ty as a statc content generator, and I'm using GitHub and TravisCI for version control, hosting, and CI/CD. Oh, and Route53 for DNS.</p>

<p>Anyway, please excuse the dust around here. I haven't stretched my web design skills in a hot minute. I've been laser focused on Unity Development and Level Design lately. My plan is to get all my content pushed up here, and then I'll do another pass on the visuals and layout. Until then, enjoy the blockout background!</p>
