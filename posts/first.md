You'll have to forgive me, I decided to rework my portfolio/blog from scratch. I was running static HTML/CSS on an Amazon S3 bucket, and finally decided it was high time to do things "the right way". This site utilizes 11ty as a statc content generator, and I'm using GitHub and TravisCI for version control, hosting, and CI/CD. 

I probably should have learned how to properly use all these tools first before taking my old portfolio down. Whoops! #MVP

Anyway, please excuse the dust around here. I haven't stretched my web design skills in a hot minute. I've been laser focused on Unity Development and Level Design lately.
