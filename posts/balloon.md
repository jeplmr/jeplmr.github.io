<p>Okay, I admit it. <a href="https://jeplmr.itch.io/balloon-ride" target="blank">Balloon Ride</a> is a Flappy Bird clone. But it's a <i>chill</i> Flappy Bird clone. I made it as a case study of progression and simple, accessible game design. I've always loved that Flappy Bird required only a single input from the player; a screen tap. I wanted to see what I could do with a similar constraint, but then layer on some difficulty ramp-up. Balloon Ride starts off as a simple game where you guide a hot air balloon through floating rings. As the player's score increases, they must pay more attention to obstacles, their balloon's fuel gauge, and trickier ring placement.</p>
