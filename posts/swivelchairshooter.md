<p>Swivel Chair Shooter was a labor of love for me. I lost countless hours to the Zombies mode in Call of Duty: World at War. I don't know why I decided to do a remake with the Oculus Go, but all that play time probably had something to do with it.</p>

<p>Whenever I sit down to "clone" something, I usually to it as a case study, or to learn something specifc. In this case, it was both. I wanted to to analyse how the game's progression worked, how the power-ups tied into that, and how the economy aspect played into the whole thing. It was also the first time I messed with mobile VR and shader graph.</p>
