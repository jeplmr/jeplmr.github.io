<p>Late in December 2018, my local Unity meetup hosted a month-long environment study challenge. The rules were simple: recreate a scene from any photo. <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1t72S2quB0F73HnqWhIXWOFzrJ5RDRX9qGtP3_yET5P8/edit?usp=sharing" target="blank">I detail my process here in these slides</a>, but the basic idea is that I took the specifications from the physical camera used to take the reference photo and applied them to the camera settings in Unity. Once I had that, I overlaid the reference photo on top of my scene in Unity and started rebuilding everything from scratch. Please excuse some of the messy geometry in the scene, I was still learning Blender at the time.</p>
