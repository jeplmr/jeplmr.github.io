<p><a href="https://memphis-game-developers.itch.io/avarus" target="blank">Avarus</a> was created for Ludum Dare 42 around the theme "running out of space". The goal of the game is to get the highest score possible by matching coins with their opposites. If there are no matches, you can exchange a coin for a handful of its matches at the expense of board space. When you run out of space, the game ends.</p>
