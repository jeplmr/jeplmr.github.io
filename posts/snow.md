<a href="https://jeplmr.itch.io/snow" target="blank">Snow</a> was created as an excuse for me to improve my shader skills. Music was created by the talented <a href="https://www.jmarlinmusic.com/" target="blank">Jonathan Marlin</a>. Stuff I learned while making Snow: 
<ul>Reading/Writing data to a splatmap texture; the players location and path taken.</ul>
<ul>Using that data to manipulate verticies on a mesh; in this case, pushing down points on a mesh to leave tracks in the "snow".</ul>
<ul>Application of random noise to splatmap to fake snow accumulation in depressed areas.</ul>
<ul>Dynamic tesselation driven by the Camera's distance from the tesselated mesh.</ul>
