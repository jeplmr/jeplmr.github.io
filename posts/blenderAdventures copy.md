<p>A collection of materials I made back in 2017, based on an office environment. Pack contains various floor, wall, and ceiling materials for use in realtime 3D rendered applications. All materials make use of Unity's built-in standard shader, which supports PBR (physically based rendering) texture maps.<a href="https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/textures-materials/pbr-office-materials-98732" target="blank">Unity Asset Store</a>.</p>
